# Diabetes-Progression_-Linear-Regression

This was done as a part of my courserwork.
Defined a gradient descent function, mse loss function for both Simple Linear Regression Model and Multiple Linear Regression Model.

Based on MSE alone, the SLR model appeared to perform better on the given dataset.
